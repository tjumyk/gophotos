# Go Photos

## Introduction

This is a tiny web server that integrates Google Client API and [又拍云(UpYun, a Chinese cloud storage provider)](https://www.upyun.com) API to automatically 
copy the selected albums from your Google Photos to UpYun and generate a share link.

As we all know, mainland China has blocked most of the Google services. The purpose of this project is to share the Google Photos albums with
parents or friends in mainland China with just one click.
